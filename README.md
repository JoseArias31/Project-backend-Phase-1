# **Phase 1 & 2**:

1st Phase:

-Created a new GitHub repository named "Project-backend-Phase-1" for the backend development.
-Set up NPM for the project.
-Created an "index.js" file with a simple console.log("Starting with Backend already.") to initialize the backend.
-Marked the project as "private" in the repository settings.
-Set up the main file "index.js" in the "package.json" with the script "start": "node src/index.js" to easily run the backend.

2nd Phase:

-Created a new branch named "Phase 2" to begin work on the next phase.
-Developed two modules: "Conditionals.js" and "operations.js".

"Conditionals.js" contains a function with three parameters that uses conditional statements for logic.
"operations.js" includes a single line of code for a simple math operation and an object representing three fake clients.

-Configured the exporting and importing processes between the modules and the main file "index.js".
-Assigned the project to a classmate to receive feedback and suggestions.
