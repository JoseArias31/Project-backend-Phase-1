# **Phase 1**:

1st Phase:

-Created a new GitHub repository named "Project-backend-Phase-1" for the backend development.
-Set up NPM for the project.
-Created an "index.js" file with a simple console.log("Starting with Backend already.") to initialize the backend.
-Marked the project as "private" in the repository settings.
-Set up the main file "index.js" in the "package.json" with the script "start": "node src/index.js" to easily run the backend.
